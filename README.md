# Liver-Diseases in India

Liver Diseases are growing common among the masses. This project was undertaken at Build-A-Bit Hackathon. The main aim of the project was to develop a full-fledged website helping the people to anticipate if they have liver diseases or not. This repository just contains the analysis and modelling part of the project.
